Resource Owner\\\nYou, the user who owns the protected resource (data).\\\n\\\n2. Client\\\nThe application that wants to access your resource.\\\n\\\n3. Resource Server\\\nThe server that hosts your protected resource.\\\n\\\n4. Authorization Server\\\nThe server that issues access tokens to the client after you grant permission.\\\n\\\nCore Idea -\\\nâ—¾ Instead of giving your credentials to the app, you give the app a temporary 'access token'.\\\nâ—¾ This token is issued by the authorization server after you've given your consent.\\\nâ—¾ The token allows the app to access specific resources on the resource server without ever knowing your credentials.\\\n\\\nðŸ“Œ The Flow -\\\n1. Client Requests Authorization\\\nâ—¾ The client directs you to the authorization server, usually through a 'Login' button.\\\n\\\n2. User Authorizes\\\nâ—¾ You log into the authorization server and give the client permission to access certain resources.\\\n\\\n3. Authorization Grant\\\nâ—¾ The authorization server sends an 'authorization grant' back to the client.\\\nâ—¾ This is a temporary code that proves you've given consent.\\\n\\\n4. Client Exchanges Grant for Token\\\nâ—¾ The client sends the authorization grant to the authorization server and requests an access token.\\\n\\\n5. Access Token Granted\\\nâ—¾ The authorization server validates the grant and issues an access token to the client.\\\n\\\n6. Client Accesses Resource\\\nâ—¾ The client uses the access token to access the protected resources on the resource server.\\\n\\\n![Oauth2](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQH7nYcxdVrIog/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1730410522974?e=1733356800&v=beta&t=MieTsqBzRAD6LSI5DBzVVAjfa9w9XL5P_c6pW5wH648)\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1954}]"
