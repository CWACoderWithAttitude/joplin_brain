1.  1.  Spotlight Effect: Most people aren’t thinking about you. (Harsh, but liberating.)
    2.  <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);">The 'Procedure or Perception' Razor: When criticism hits, ask yourself: ‘Do I need to change my actions? Or just my perception?’ Skip constructive feedback from those who've never constructed anything.</span>
    3.  The 10% Hater Rule (credit Tim Ferriss): Remember this formula: 10% of people will dislike anything. Even water. Even puppies. Even you. It's not personal—it's math.
    4.  Growth Mindset: Every master was once a disaster. Every expert was once a beginner. Every success story starts with showing up.
